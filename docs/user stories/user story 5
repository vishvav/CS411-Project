User Story 5

As a user I want this application to be secure and private, so that this webpage can only be accessed by people with an account.

Front:

-The user is required to make an account before even being able to see the home page

-Once the user logs out they are not able to access the webpage

Back:
-The home and game page are login_required, and as the name implies, the user will be denied access unless they are logged in

-In the _init_.py file the security measures for login and establishing the database are set.
