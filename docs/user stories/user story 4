User Story 4
As a user, I want to be able to compare the images I have generated to the original image I based my prompt off of.

Front:
-Have the same datepicker and image display on the /game route for the user to be able to change the picture 

-The user will be able to enter their prompt in a textbox below the image display

Back:
-Save information so that the image does not default back to the image of the day, but instead to the date that the user selected

-Give the data from the json files to the jinja templates so that the information from the NASA and OpenAI APIs will be reflected on the actual page.
