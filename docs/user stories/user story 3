User Story 3
As a user I want to be able to generate images based on my own text prompt.

Front: 
-The user will be able to navigate from the home page to the game page.

-There will be a text field available for the user to enter a prompt. 

-When they are done they can submit the prompt and this prompt will be sent to the OpenAI API, so that 3 images can be generated based on their prompt

-These images will be displayed on the page

Back:
-The user input from the form will be retrieved and entered into the OpenAi API, along with all the other required parameters to generate the 3 images, and store this data in a json file as well.

-This will be done in a new function that routes to /game, instead of a home page
