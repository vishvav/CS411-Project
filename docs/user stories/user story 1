User Story 1:
As a user, I want to be able to create an account to access the application.

Front:
-There will be an option to create an account

-There will be fields that have the user enter their email, password to create an account

Back:
-Use the database to store user information so that the user will be able to login and log back out.

-Write code that makes sure the password is longer than a certain length for security purposes
