User Story 1:
As a user, I want to be able to create an account to access the application so that I can change my preferences and make sure that my experience with the application is tailored to me.

Front:
-There will be an option to create an account

-In the settings there will be all the preference options listed and the user will be able to toggle whichever ones on or off and save their changes.

Back:
-Be able to register users and store all data relevant to one user so that their preferences will be fulfilled upon login

-Verify which preferences are turned on and off so that the application will change to the users preferences.
