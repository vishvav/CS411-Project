User Story 2

As a user, I want to be able to see the picture of the day and previous dates.

Front:
-There will be a datepicker form in which the user can enter any day after June 16, 1995 (when the NASA APOD started)

-The picture of the day will be displayed by default, and once the user submits the date they chose, the picture will update to the corresponding day


Back:
-The value in the datepicker form will be read to see if it Null or not, and if it not a new json file containing data from the Nasa APOD API will be generated.

-The new json file's data will be rendered with the template for the corresponding page, so the picture will change when the page is rendered following the datepicker submission
