User Story 2

As a user, I want to customize the products I want to track, so the most relevant information to me is in one place.

Front:
-The user will be able to edit their product lists, having the option to delete or add items to the list 

-The user will be able to rank which products are most relevant to them

-The user will receive a notification if one of their products is out of stock

Back:
-Verify which items have been chosen to be deleted or added and add them to the stored user data so that it will update for the user.

-Sort the list of products so that the products correspond to the user ranking 

-Verify the stock of each product and if it goes out of stock, notify the user via their chosen method of communication.
