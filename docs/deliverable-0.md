# CS411 Project Proposal
 
## By Vishva, Karla, Jack, Ruiding
 
 
Idea:
Correlate the NASA APOD (A Picture of the Day) API with the OpenAI API by creating a guessing game in which the user can pick a date and have the corresponding NASA Picture of the Day be displayed, and they will be able to type in a prompt to generate 3 images from the OpenAI API. They can then see how similar their generated images are to the picture of the day and try again or enjoy their results.
 
Front end: Bootstrap and Jinja2 frontend.
Back end: Flask
Databases: mySQL
API: NASA APOD API and OpenAI API
