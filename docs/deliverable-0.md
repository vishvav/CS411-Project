# CS411 Project Proposal

## By Vishva, Karla, Jack, Ruiding


Idea #1: 
Use Amazon API to track price fluctuations of select items, these prices can be monitered and compared to other sites for example. Can also make a feature where we notify users of price drop and average price history etc. Users can select what items to track and if they have reached an all time low. A user can make a profile where all this info can be stored. It can even have a system where it can reccomend rebious items you have tracked/bought on a regular basis i.e. laundry detergent, water, etc.

Idea #2:
Use Spotify API to take user's songs and find samples used in these songs. The user then can listen to the sampled song in its original form in a separate playlist. Each user can choose a song and then the sampled songs would be put into a playlist for the user to browse, compare, and listen to. Much like how Shazam add's the songs you've searched up to a playlist.
