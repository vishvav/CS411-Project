# CS411 Project
Lab B4 Team 1's Group Project for BU CS411

We built a game where a user will be presented the Nasa Image of the Day (custom dates can be selected) along with a input field asking the user to describe the Nasa image as accurately as possible. This written description is then sent to OpenAI to generate 3 images and displayed along side the original Nasa Image, the goal is to genegrate an image as close to the real Nasa image using descriptive langauge. 

Possible Applications: Langauge learning (ESL students can test their vocabulary and knowledge in adjectives by describing the image in their native tounge and comparing it in a langauge they are learning) 
* this is possible as OpenAI supports most major langauges in their Image Generation
